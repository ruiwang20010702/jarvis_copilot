What comes to your mind first? A machine stronger than the human body? However, this same quality is now causing a big problem—it''s creating tons of long-lasting e-waste that could flood our planet. What if, instead, the machines we use were designed to break down and disappear—just as living things do?
For a study published in Science Advances, researchers made a robotic arm and a controller using materials from animals and plants. These materials are strong enough to work but can easily break down in a natural environment. After testing, both parts were gone in soil within weeks.
Biodegradable robotics often falls under the umbrella of soft robotics, which takes ideas from nature. "This field started in materials science and chemistry rather than traditional robots that come from mechanical engineering," says Florian Hartmann, a materials scientist from Germany. However, many early soft robotics models still used man-made materials that cause pollution.
Wei, a scientist who studies natural materials in Hangzhou, worked together with his friend Zhang, a robotics engineer in Shanghai, to build robots for the new study. They started with cellulose taken from cotton. Then, they added glycerol to make a new material that is soft and easy to change shapes. After that they allowed it to dry so it became strong. "Cellulose is cheap and easy to work with," says Wei. They found that the controller and the robotic arm stood up to both heavy use and a week of inactivity. Finally, they buried them both in a hole. Within eight weeks these two parts were almost completely gone.
Wei and Zhang expect that robots like these can be used to deal with dangerous waste and then disappear naturally. They also hope that such robots can aid doctors in operations and then safely break down inside the body.
However, it''s important to note that the technology is still in very early stages. "If we truly want to have a biodegradable robot," Hartmann says, "we also need to make sure its electronics and power parts are biodegradable."

You might think of a strong machine. But this strength causes a big problem—lots of e-waste that harms our planet. What if robots could break down naturally, like living things?

Researchers made a robotic arm and controller from animal and plant materials. These materials are strong but can break down easily in nature. After testing, they disappeared in soil within weeks.

This is part of soft robotics, which gets ideas from nature. Florian Hartmann, a materials scientist, says this field started in materials science, not mechanical engineering. Early models still used polluting materials.

Wei, a scientist in Hangzhou, and Zhang, a robotics engineer in Shanghai, built robots for a new study. They used cellulose from cotton and added glycerol to make a soft, shape-changing material. After drying, it became strong. "Cellulose is cheap and easy to use," says Wei. The robot parts worked well and then almost completely disappeared in eight weeks when buried.

Wei and Zhang hope these robots can handle dangerous waste and help in surgeries, then break down safely. But Hartmann warns that the technology is still new.

These components are strong enough to perform tasks but can easily decompose in nature. This type of technology belongs to a field called "soft robotics," which draws inspiration from nature. Florian Hartmann, a materials scientist from Germany, explains that soft robotics started in chemistry and materials science rather than mechanical engineering. Unfortunately, many earlier soft robots still relied on synthetic materials that pollute the Earth.

To solve this, Wei, a scientist in Hangzhou, partnered with Zhang, a robotics engineer in Shanghai. They started their process with cellulose taken from cotton. By adding glycerol, they created a soft material that they could shape easily. When they allowed it to dry, it became durable. "Cellulose is cheap and easy to work with," Wei noted. During testing, the robotic arm and controller handled heavy use effectively. Even after a week of sitting idle, they remained strong. Finally, the team buried the parts in soil. Within eight weeks, the robot parts were almost completely gone.

Wei and Zhang see a bright future for this technology. They expect that these biodegradable robots could handle dangerous waste and then vanish naturally. They also hope that these devices could assist doctors during surgeries and then safely dissolve inside the body. However, the technology is still in its early stages. Hartmann points out a remaining challenge: "If we truly want to have a biodegradable robot, we also need to make sure its electronics and power parts are biodegradable."', 'draft', NULL, '2025-12-17 07:32:39.709652');

What comes to your mind first? A machine stronger than the human body? However, this same quality is now causing a big problem—it''s creating tons of long-lasting e-waste that could flood our planet. What if, instead, the machines we use were designed to break down and disappear—just as living things do?
For a study published in Science Advances, researchers made a robotic arm and a controller using materials from animals and plants. These materials are strong enough to work but can easily break down in a natural environment. After testing, both parts were gone in soil within weeks.
Biodegradable robotics often falls under the umbrella of soft robotics, which takes ideas from nature. "This field started in materials science and chemistry rather than traditional robots that come from mechanical engineering," says Florian Hartmann, a materials scientist from Germany. However, many early soft robotics models still used man-made materials that cause pollution.
Wei, a scientist who studies natural materials in Hangzhou, worked together with his friend Zhang, a robotics engineer in Shanghai, to build robots for the new study. They started with cellulose taken from cotton. Then, they added glycerol to make a new material that is soft and easy to change shapes. After that they allowed it to dry so it became strong. "Cellulose is cheap and easy to work with," says Wei. They found that the controller and the robotic arm stood up to both heavy use and a week of inactivity. Finally, they buried them both in a hole. Within eight weeks these two parts were almost completely gone.
Wei and Zhang expect that robots like these can be used to deal with dangerous waste and then disappear naturally. They also hope that such robots can aid doctors in operations and then safely break down inside the body.
However, it''s important to note that the technology is still in very early stages. "If we truly want to have a biodegradable robot," Hartmann says, "we also need to make sure its electronics and power parts are biodegradable."
